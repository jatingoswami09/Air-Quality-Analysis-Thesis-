##Advancing Air Quality Forecasting in Delhi

This repository contains the complete documentation and datasets for my final thesis, "Advancing Air Quality Forecasting in Delhi: Application of Advanced Time Series Models." The project aims to develop and enhance models to accurately forecast air quality levels in Delhi, leveraging advanced time series analysis techniques.

#Project Overview
Objective: To improve the accuracy of air quality forecasts in Delhi by applying ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM models, and to analyze the impact of significant events like lockdowns on air quality.
Solution: Utilized historical air quality data to build, validate, and compare various forecasting models. Conducted comprehensive data analysis, including temporal and spatial patterns, correlations, and the effects of lockdown measures on pollutant levels.

#Key Achievements:
Developed models that forecast air quality levels with enhanced accuracy.
Identified significant temporal patterns and trends influencing air pollution in Delhi.
Analyzed the impact of lockdown measures on air quality, providing valuable insights for policymakers.
Contributed to advancing knowledge in environmental data analysis and forecasting methodologies.
